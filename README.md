# Implementation for the thesis "practical graph coloring algorithms" by Gitte Van Orshoven

This repository holds the implementation, graphs, and data used for the thesis "practical graph coloring algorithms" made in the context of the Master in Engineering: Computer Science study at the KU Leuven.

###Bruteforce implementation
* bounds.c: implementation for the different upper bounds of the chromatic number
* bruteforce.c: file with the starting point (main function) for the bruteforce algorithm
* coloring.c: implementation of the bruteforce approach to find a proper vertex coloring for the graph
* graph.c: data representation of the graph as well as implementations to read a graph from an input file
* heuristics.c: all functionality for selecting the next vertex to be colored (and a color to color the vertex) according to the sorting heuristics
* low-k.c specialized implementation for k-colorings for low values (2, 3, or 4) of k
* search.c: implementation of the different search methods
* HOW TO RUN: compile the bruteforce.c file with the -lm flag (the other listed files need to be present in the same directory), run the compiled program with the following arguments:
  * (relative or absolute) path to the file of the graph
  * number of vertices of the graph
  * (in case of k-coloring) the maximal number of colors allowed
  * Example:
    * gcc -O3 bruteforce.c -lm -o bruteforce
    * ./bruteforce graph.col 10 3

###Dynamic programming
* dynamic_programming.c

###Data
The file "data.ods" holds all the data generated by the benchmarks. The following sheets are present in the file:
* Benchmark Graphs and Sets: all the graphs used for benchmarking along with their characteristics categorization into different sets.
* KCOLORING: Execution times for computing k-colorings for different values of k relative to X(G). 
  Comparison for k-colorings with low values of k between standard bruteforce approach and a specialized algorithm. 
  Large set of execution times for X(G)-1 colorings and X(G) colorings in function of |V|.
